Here’s a quick guide to using these basic networking commands in Linux, along with brief explanations for each command’s purpose and syntax.

1. Ping
Used to test the connectivity between your system and a remote host, ping sends a series of ICMP Echo Request packets to the target.

Syntax:

bash
Copy code
ping <hostname or IP>
Example:

bash
Copy code
ping google.com
This command sends continuous pings to google.com. Use Ctrl + C to stop it.

2. Traceroute (tracert)
Used to trace the route that packets take to reach a destination host, showing each hop and the response time.

Syntax:

bash
Copy code
traceroute <hostname or IP>
Example:

bash
Copy code
traceroute google.com
This command shows the path packets take from your computer to google.com. Note: You may need to install traceroute on some systems with sudo apt-get install traceroute.

3. Nslookup
Used to find the IP address associated with a domain name and vice versa.

Syntax:

bash
Copy code
nslookup <hostname or IP>
Example:

bash
Copy code
nslookup google.com
This command queries DNS servers to resolve google.com to its IP address.

4. Netstat
Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, and other network-related information.

Syntax:

bash
Copy code
netstat <options>
Examples:

netstat -a: Shows all connections.
netstat -tuln: Shows listening ports (TCP and UDP).
netstat -r: Displays the routing table.
5. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
Used to display or manipulate the ARP cache, which stores IP-to-MAC address mappings.

Syntax:

bash
Copy code
arp <options>
Examples:

arp -a: Lists all entries in the ARP table.
arp -d <IP>: Deletes an ARP entry.
6. RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)
RARP is used by a host to request its IP address based on its MAC address. It's mostly replaced by DHCP in modern networks.

In Linux, RARP is generally not a standalone command but may be accessed through networking utilities if your system supports it.

7. ip
A modern alternative to ifconfig, the ip command is used for configuring network interfaces, routes, and more.

Syntax:

bash
Copy code
ip <object> <command>
Examples:

ip a: Shows IP addresses on all interfaces.
ip link: Shows network interfaces.
ip route: Shows the routing table.
8. Ifconfig
Used to view or configure network interface settings. It is being replaced by ip but is still available on many systems.

Syntax:

bash
Copy code
ifconfig <interface> <options>
Examples:

ifconfig: Lists all active interfaces.
ifconfig eth0 up: Activates the eth0 interface.
ifconfig eth0 down: Deactivates the eth0 interface.
9. dig
dig (Domain Information Groper) is a DNS lookup tool that retrieves DNS records for a domain.

Syntax:

bash
Copy code
dig <hostname>
Example:

bash
Copy code
dig google.com
This command fetches DNS information about google.com.

10. Route
Shows and manipulates the IP routing table.//
